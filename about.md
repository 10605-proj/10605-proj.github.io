The Machine Learning community is currently experiencing a [reproducibility crisis](https://neuripsconf.medium.com/designing-the-reproducibility-program-for-neurips-2020-7fcccaa5c6ad) and a reviewing crisis~\citep{littman2021collusion}.
Because of the highly competitive reviewing process of ML conferences, results in papers are sometimes oversold, thus slowing down the overall progress of the scientific community.
The \href{https://ml-retrospectives.github.io}{ML Retrospectives Workshop} was created to give researchers an opportunity to reflect on their work and their limitations.
The final goal of this initiative was to bring more transparency and openness when discussing scientific papers to ``make research more human.''

Blog posts are a (relatively) novel and interesting format to talk about science~\citep{brown2018science}.
They can have a substantial scientific value for the community because they provide new insights, intuitions and foster discussion on published ideas.
This format allows the writers to discuss ideas in a more informal way than scientific papers.
It is thus a convenient medium for open, human, and transparent discussions about either new insights or the limitations of a scientific publication.


However, because they are not as recognized as standard scientific publications, only a minority of researchers get visibility for their blog posts publications.
Most of them are well-established researchers (\href{https://francisbach.com/}{Francis Bach}, \href{https://www.argmin.net/}{Ben Recht}, \href{https://www.inference.vc/}{Ferenc Husz√°r}, \href{https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/}{Lilian Weng}) or big corporations (\href{https://ai.facebook.com/blog/?page=1}{Facebook AI}, \href{https://ai.googleblog.com/}{Google AI}, \href{https://deepmind.com/blog}{DeepMind}, \href{https://openai.com/blog/}{OpenAI}).

The current incentives are only long-term, and sometimes such a blogging activity is not given recognition by the scientific community~\citep{brown2018science}.
Our goal is to create a formal call for blog posts at ICLR to incentivize and reward researchers to develop new intuition and reflect on published work.
